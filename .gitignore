# tradecontrol-exports .gitignore
# This template blends Python and .NET ignore rules because the repo spans both worlds:
# - Python: for LibreOffice/ODS export scripts (ignores __pycache__, venvs, build/dist, etc.)
# - .NET: for integration with ASP.NET (ignores bin/obj, DLLs, EXEs, etc.)
# - Editors/OS: ignores VS Code, JetBrains, and system junk files
# - Outputs: ignores generated spreadsheets (XLSX, ODS, CSV) so only source code is tracked
#
# The goal is to keep the repo clean and focused on source + configs,
# while preventing accidental commits of build artifacts or user exports.
